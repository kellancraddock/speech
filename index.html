<h2>Initial thank you</h2>

<p><em>Welcome</em>...Welcome everybody.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for <em>being</em> here. We're both <em>thrilled</em> that you could be a part of this <em>special</em> evening, and <em>can't wait</em> to party the night away. Before we do, I'd like to say a few quick thanks you&rsquo;s.</p>

<h2>Inlaws</h2>
<p>Of course I can't start without thanking my new inlaws, Joan and Keith Tsuji.  Joan and Keith have been nothing short of <em>amazing</em> while Jessica and I were dating. <em>Beyond</em> just being <em>supportive</em>, they always made the extra effort to make me feel <em>welcome</em>.</p>

<p>Seven years ago when Jess and I first met I was on a slightly different <em>life track</em>. I was a guitar wielding, long haired rocker <em>who spent his time</em> playing music. So i can see why the Tsuji's <em>could</em> have been <em>wary</em> when I started flying from Kauai to Maui to date their daughter.</p>

<p>But it wasn't like that in the least. In fact,  the Tsuji's made me feel like <em>part of the family</em> almost instantly. And the <em>great thing</em> is, that I i've grown to <em>admire</em> these same traits in Jessica. Her <em>warmth, generosity, and loving nature</em> are reflections of Joan and Keith's relationship with each other. So thank you, not only for <em>supporting</em> our relationship, but for being a <em>model</em> for Jessica and I to follow in our life together.</p>

<p>And by the way, for those of you who don't know, the Tsuji's have been absolutely <em>instrumental</em> in planning this amazing evening. As soon as we told them that we were engaged, Joan and Keith went to work checking out <em>venues</em>, making <em>arrangements</em> and taking <em>pictures</em> for us to see back in Portland. So thank you very much for making this night <em>possible</em>, and to all of you, if you get a chance to see them, please <em>thank them as well</em>.</p>

<h2>Parents</h2>
<p><em>We also can't</em> get this night kicked off without saying thank you to my parents. You know my parents were <em>really great</em> growing up. They're the kind of parents who are always <em>supportive</em>, </em>positive</em>, the kind of parents that had a <em>knack</em> for giving right <em>advice</em> at the right time. So when it came to dating their advice was simple and succinct: <em>Find</em> someone who loves you for who you are both flaws and strengths.</p>

<p>Now <em>at the time</em> I probably thought something like: "Hey that sounds really good, but obviously my parents have been out of the <em>dating circuit</em> for a really long time. They probably have absolutely <em>no idea</em> what it's actually like to date these days. I mean, find someone that love's your flaws? Like that's ever going to happen!"</p>

<p>Well I <em>took</em> your advice to heart, I'm standing up here in front of you <em>knowing</em> that I did better. Not only do I have someone who <em>compliments</em> me in every way, I have someone who has <em>redefined</em> my <em>understanding</em> of what it is to truly <em>know</em> someone, to truly <em>love</em> someone. I'm fortunate enough to have a <em>wife who supports</em> me without <em>exception</em>, while at the same time, pushes me to be a <em>stronger</em> person. She is my <em>other half</em>, my <em>soul</em> mate, and the <em>love</em> of my life… and on top of it…she's a <em>knock out</em>! I mean did I do <em>good</em>, or did I do GOOD?</p>

<p>So thank you for your <em>guidance</em>, <em>support</em> and <em>love</em>. Jessica and I will always <em>welcome</em> it.</p>

<h2>Wedding Party</h2>
<p>To our wedding party. <em>Each</em> of you are so much more than just a groomsman and bridesmaid, a maid of honor or a best man. You're some of our <em>dearest</em> and <em>closest</em> friends. So we thank you, not only for <em>tonight</em> and the <em>great times</em> we've already shared together, but for your <em>continued support</em> and <em>friendship</em> for years to come. Jessica and I both look forward to <em>sharing</em> many happy memories with all of you.</p>

<h2>Grandparents</h2>
<p>To our grandparents, Don and Betty Craddock, Art and Rose Melchor, Papa Rocky Mishina. We <em>look</em> to the <em>lives</em> you've lead as inspiration on a daily basis, and we thank you for always being there for us.</p>

<h2>Family and Friends</h2>
<p>Of course thank you to my Aunt Lily and Aunt Diane who <em>graciously volunteered</em> to help as MC and day-of Coordinator, and to the friends and family, cousins, aunties and uncles who <em>helped</em> set up, bought <em>gifts</em> from the registry, or simply <em>sent</em> their thoughts and prays to us. You've made this day so <em>special</em>. We really couldn't have done it without you.</p>

<p>Jessica and I really appreciate <em>having</em> every one of you here, we know that <em>some</em> of you have even traveled very far to be with us tonight.</p>

<h2>Toast</h2>
<p>And with that I'd like to propose a toast, to all of you, our <em>friends and family</em> who <em>support</em> and <em>inspire</em> us in <em>life</em>. And of course, to my <em>beautiful</em> new bride, here&rsquo;s to a <em>wonderful</em> evening and the <em>memories</em> yet to come. Cheers.</p>
